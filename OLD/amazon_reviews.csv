"I’ve tried and returned many mice over the course of the past 2 weeks. This one is my favorite. The wireless is nice and I still like the ability to plug directly into my pc if needed. I haven’t noticed any delay or anything. However If you like rgb this mouse is probably not for you, with the Logitech logo being the only thing lit up, and adding anything else will cut the battery life in half.

This mouse is comfortable to use, the buttons are easy to use, but you also won’t accidentally press one in, potentially messing you up in a game. The scroll wheel has a free scroll mode which has no resistance and will just keep rolling, and a resistance mode where it is clicky. I like the option for both depending on what I’m using it for. I also like the weights and the ability to make the mouse slightly heavier or lighter.

The software is eh but not terrible. Navigation is simple with three menus, one for dpi, the second for button assignments, and the third for lighting.

Overall I like it, it’s the best of the 8 I’ve tried including products from SteelSeries, Corsair, ASUS, Roccat, and Razer. Logitech won in my opinion."
"This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
"This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
"The mouse is great for all things and has a weight system for better balance for FPS games or games that need precision cursor movements. The mouse fits well in the hand, buttons are easy to find and reach. The scroll wheel is rigid for precision scrolling but, has a release button for rapid scrolling.
The one I have now, I have had for a few years and is just starting to have optical ""fuzzy"" moments. I have about another year or two on my current one so, I picked up 2 more! Future Proofing!
I really enjoyed the model prior to this model of Logitech Gaming mouse and, they were one of my favorites to use. Then, Logitech discontinued that model for this one. I was suspect on it because, the weight system really makes a difference in comfort. I tried the G502 Hero and, I was instantly pleased. The comfort, weights, and durability was still there. The only thing I miss in the G502 is a slightly higher palm area. Other than that, the price is perfect for the quality you receive."
